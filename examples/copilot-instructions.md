# AK firmware — agent instructions

This project is firmware for the **AK (Active Kernel)** event-driven MCU framework.

You have access to the **`ak-docs` MCP server**. Use it as the source of truth — do
not guess AK APIs from memory.

Before writing or changing any firmware:

1. Call **`get_ak_guardrails`** first. Never modify `application/sources/ak/` (kernel),
   `boot/`, `application/sources/networks/`, or `application/sources/common/`.
   Build features in `application/sources/app/` and `application/sources/driver/` only.
2. For a new task/driver/screen, call **`get_ak_guide`** (`create-task`,
   `create-driver`, `create-screen`, `use-timer`, `isr-bridge`, `tune-pools`) and follow
   the steps and skeleton exactly.
3. For any kernel function/macro, call **`get_ak_api`** to get the exact signature and
   arguments. Use **`search_ak_docs`** when you don't know the symbol name.

Hard rules (also returned by `get_ak_guardrails`):

- Handlers must be **non-blocking** — no `delay()`, no busy-wait. Use a timer that posts a
  signal instead.
- Tasks communicate **only via messages** (`task_post_*`), never direct calls or shared
  globals.
- User signals start at `AK_USER_DEFINE_SIG` (10); task priorities are `LEVEL_1..7`
  (0 is reserved).
- Common message payload ≤ 64 bytes; max 7 references per message; pools are fixed size.
